A simple Reed Solomon encoder / decoder
=======================================

The decoder is implemented according to a paper by Dilip V. Sarwate, Naresh R. Shanbhag ([available on citeseer](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.592.6625&rep=rep1&type=pdf)) and was used to verify a systolic VLSI implementation.

Not particularly efficient in terms of simulation time but well commented and may prove
educational
